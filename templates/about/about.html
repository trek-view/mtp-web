                    <h3>A call for help...</h3>
                    <p>Trek View is currently run as a side-project to my day job. Whilst myself and the generous contributions of others help us maintain and improve our open source software, hosting and software costs for our projects are not always free.</p>
                    <p>I currently pay $200 each month out of my own pocket to keep Map the Paths online and freely available to users without ads.</p>
                    <p>My intention is to keep as much of this app free as is possible, but for some features we need your support as a Patreon. Your money will go directly to growing this project and awesome new features.</p>
                    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/trekview">Please click here to support the project (from Â£5/mo)</a>.</p>

                    <p>Trek View is using street-level panoramic maps of the natural world to inspire everyone to preserve it.</p>
                    <p>We use computer vision to classify what's inside an image; from species of trees and their health, to coastal erosion and its impact.</p>
                    <p>Our work is used by researchers to quickly understand the health of the environment so they can generate solutions to protect it.</p>
